USE Statement

Definition:
The USE statement selects a specific database as the active database for the current session.

How it works:
After a database is selected using USE, all subsequent SQL operations such as reading, inserting, updating, or deleting data are performed on that database unless another database is specified.

Why it is important:
It prevents ambiguity when multiple databases exist and ensures queries run on the correct dataset.

SELECT Statement

Definition:
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.

How it works:
It allows users to choose specific columns or computed results and display them in the query output.

Why it is important:
SELECT is the foundation of data retrieval and reporting in SQL.

FROM Clause

Definition:
The FROM clause specifies the source table(s) from which data is retrieved.

How it works:
SQL identifies where the data exists before applying filters, grouping, or calculations.

Why it is important:
Without FROM, SQL would not know where to retrieve the data from.

CASE Statement

Definition:
The CASE statement is a conditional expression in SQL that returns different values based on specified conditions, similar to an if-else structure in programming languages.

How it works:
SQL evaluates conditions in order and returns the result associated with the first true condition. If no condition is met, a default result is returned.

Why it is important:
It is widely used for categorizing data, transforming values, handling business logic, and improving report readability.

Subquery (Derived Table)

Definition:
A subquery is a query nested inside another SQL statement.

How it works:
The inner query executes first, and its result is used by the outer query as a temporary dataset.

Why it is important:
Subqueries enable complex calculations, intermediate transformations, and modular query design.

Aggregate Functions
Definition

Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single summarized value.

Common Aggregates

SUM: Calculates total values

COUNT: Counts rows

AVG: Calculates average

MIN / MAX: Finds smallest or largest values

Why they are important

They are essential for summarizing data, generating reports, and analyzing trends.

GROUP BY Clause

Definition:
GROUP BY groups rows that share the same values into summary rows.

How it works:
Aggregate functions operate on each group separately rather than on the entire dataset.

Why it is important:
It allows meaningful aggregation such as totals per category, customer, or time period.

ORDER BY Clause

Definition:
ORDER BY sorts the result set based on one or more columns.

How it works:
Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order.

Why it is important:
It improves data readability and is commonly used in reporting and dashboards.

Column and Table Aliases

Definition:
Aliases provide temporary, readable names for columns or tables.

How it works:
They exist only during query execution and do not affect the database structure.

Why it is important:
Aliases make complex queries easier to understand and outputs more user-friendly.

NULL Values

Definition:
NULL represents missing, unknown, or undefined data.

How it works:
NULL is not equal to zero or an empty string and requires special handling.

Why it is important:
Improper handling of NULL values can lead to incorrect calculations and misleading results.

Handling NULL Values

Definition:
Handling NULL values means replacing or managing missing data to ensure accurate results.

How it works:
Logical expressions or built-in functions can substitute NULL values with meaningful defaults.

Why it is important:
Ensures data accuracy, consistency, and reliable decision-making.

Window Functions

Definition:
Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row without collapsing the result set.

How it works:
They compute results over a defined window of data while preserving individual rows.

Why it is important:
Used for running totals, averages, rankings, and advanced analytics.

OVER Clause

Definition:
The OVER clause defines the window or range of rows for a window function.

How it works:
It controls how rows are grouped or ordered for calculation purposes.

Why it is important:
It enables advanced analytical operations without grouping data.

Conditional Aggregation

Definition:
Conditional aggregation applies conditions inside aggregate functions.

How it works:
Only rows meeting specific criteria contribute to the aggregate result.

Why it is important:
It allows flexible, business-specific summaries without complex filtering.

WHERE vs HAVING (Conceptual Difference)

WHERE:
Filters individual rows before grouping.

HAVING:
Filters grouped results after aggregation.

Why it matters:
Understanding this difference is crucial for writing correct analytical queries.
