## Day 1 – SQL Basics (Introduction & First Queries)
🚀 What I Learned Today
Day 1 focuses on building a strong foundation in SQL basics. The goal of this day is to understand what SQL is, why it is used, and how to write simple queries to retrieve data from a database.
This day is designed for beginners and helps in getting comfortable with basic SQL syntax.

## Day 2 — SQL: Aggregate Functions, JOINs & Operators
🚀 What I Learned Today
On Day 2 of the 30-Days-of-SQL-Challenge, I practiced and explored key SQL concepts used to analyze and combine data efficiently:
✔️ SQL Operators — compare and filter data using operators like =, >, <, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, etc.
✔️ Aggregate Functions — perform calculations over multiple rows such as COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() to summarize data. 
✔️ JOINs — combine related rows from two or more tables using matching keys.
