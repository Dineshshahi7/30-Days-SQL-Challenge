## Day 1 – SQL Basics (Introduction & First Queries)
🚀 What I Learned Today
Day 1 focuses on building a strong foundation in SQL basics. The goal of this day is to understand what SQL is, why it is used, and how to write simple queries to retrieve data from a database.
This day is designed for beginners and helps in getting comfortable with basic SQL syntax.

## Day 2 — SQL: Aggregate Functions, JOINs & Operators
🚀 What I Learned Today
On Day 2 of the 30-Days-of-SQL-Challenge, I practiced and explored key SQL concepts used to analyze and combine data efficiently:
 - SQL Operators — compare and filter data using operators like =, >, <, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, etc.
 - Aggregate Functions — perform calculations over multiple rows such as COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() to summarize data. 
 - JOINs — combine related rows from two or more tables using matching keys.

## Day 3 — SQL: Set Operators & Their Rules
🚀 What I Learned Today
On Day 3 of the 30-Days-of-SQL-Challenge, I focused on understanding Set Operators in SQL, their rules, and how they differ from JOINs. This day helped me clearly understand how SQL combines result sets and how logical mistakes can occur even without runtime errors.

# Day 4 — SQL: Functions, String Functions & Date-Time Methods

🚀 What I Learned Today 
On **Day 4 of the 30-Days-of-SQL-Challenge**, I focused on learning **SQL Functions**, especially **String Functions** and **Date & Time creation methods**. This day helped me understand how SQL functions simplify queries, clean and transform data, and handle date-time values efficiently in real-world scenarios.
