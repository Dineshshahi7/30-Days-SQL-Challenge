# Set Operators
-> Set operators in SQL combine the  results of multiple queries into a single result set.

# Difference between SET OPERATORS and JOIN in SQL
-> 
- Set Operators are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries row-wise, whereas JOIN is used to combine data from two or more tables column-wise based on a common column. 

- Set operators require the same number of columns with similar data types and include UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT/MINUS. They do not require any relationship between tables and UNION removes duplicate rows by default. In contrast, JOIN requires a relationship (primary key–foreign key) between tables and includes types such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.
 
- Set operators merge similar data from different queries, while JOIN retrieves related data from different tables in a single result set.

# Rules 

* RULE 1 | SQL Clauses
- SET Operator can be used almost in all clauses 
  WHERE | JOIN| GROUP BY | HAVING
- ORDER BY is allowed only once at the end of the query


* RULE 2 | Number of Columns
- The number of columns in each query must be same

* RULE 3 | Data Types
- Data types of columns in each query must be compatible

* RULE 4 | Order of Columns
- The order of the columns in each query must be the same

* RULE 5 | Columns Aliases
- The column names in the result set are determined by the column names specified in the first query
- That's means first query controls the result set column names (second query ko column names totally unseen hunxa)

* RULE 6 | Correct Columns
- Even if all rules are met and SQL shows no errors, the result may be incorrect
- Incorrect column selection leads to inaccurate results
